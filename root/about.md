I was born and raised in the small town of Seeley Lake, Montana.  I grew up working at my parent's guest ranch as a trail guide and mule packer, where I developed an appreciation for the outdoors.  

Once I attended college I also added to computers and electronics to my interests, and the intellectual challenges provided by them.  

After graduation, I plan to stay in the Rocky Mountain or Pacific Northwest, where I can find opportunities in the tech field while still living in a place where I can fish, ride, snowboard, and generally enjoy the outdoors.
