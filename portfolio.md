I created this software with a team of four in the Software Science course at the University of Montana.  The accounting software was implemented in Java using JavaFX for the GUI and an MVC architecture.  We used scrims and sprints in an Agile development.

## Sequence Search

#### Description:

I made program for C++ optimization class at the University of Montana.  The goal was create an optimal program for quick sequence search over a large genome.  I utilized bit-packing, binary search, and DMA (direct memory access) in order to implement it.  My solution was the second fastest in the class, with a 10x speedup over the 3rd place.
